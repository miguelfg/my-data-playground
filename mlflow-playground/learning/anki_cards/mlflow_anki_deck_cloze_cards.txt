# CLOZE DELETION CARDS
# Core Concepts
The primary purpose of MLflow [...] is to manage the machine learning lifecycle.;Tracking

In MLflow, a single training execution is called an [...];run

MLflow allows logging of [...], [...], and [...] during model training.;parameters, metrics, artifacts

The MLflow component used for standardizing model packaging and deployment is called [...];Models

Autologging in MLflow automatically tracks metrics and parameters for [...] ML frameworks;supported

The [...] component of MLflow provides a centralized place for versioning and managing machine learning models.;Model Registry

MLflow can log models from different ML frameworks like [...], [...], and [...];scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow

# Advanced Concepts
In MLflow, setting the tracking URI to [...] allows storing experiment data in a local directory.;./mlruns

MLflow projects can be packaged and shared using [...] or [...];conda environments, Docker containers

The Model Registry supports [...] like staging, archiving, and transitioning between model versions.;lifecycle management

# Technical Details
To start an MLflow experiment, you first set the experiment with [...] and then use [...] to track a run.;mlflow.set_experiment(), mlflow.start_run()

Logging a scikit-learn model in MLflow is done using the [...] method.;mlflow.sklearn.log_model()

# Workflow Patterns
The typical MLflow workflow involves [...], [...], and [...];experiment tracking, model logging, model registry

# Integration Patterns
MLflow can be integrated with [...] platforms for enhanced machine learning lifecycle management.;Databricks, Azure ML, AWS SageMaker
